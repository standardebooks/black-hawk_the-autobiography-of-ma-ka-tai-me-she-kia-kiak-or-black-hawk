				<p>I do hereby certify, that Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, or Black Hawk, did call upon me, on his return to his people in August last, and expressed a great desire to have a History of his Life written and published, in order (as he said) “that the people of the United States, (among whom he had been traveling, and by whom he had been treated with great respect, friendship and hospitality,) might know the <em>cause</em> that had impelled him to acts as he had done, and the <em>principles</em> by which he was governed.”</p>
				<p>In accordance with his request, I acted as Interpreter; and was particularly cautious to understand distinctly the narrative of Black Hawk throughout⁠—and have examined the work carefully since its completion, and have no hesitation in pronouncing it strictly correct, in all its particulars.</p>
				<p>Given under my hand, at the Sac and Fox agency, the day and date above written.</p>
