				<h3 epub:type="title">At Yellow Banks</h3>
				<p>Among the many hundreds of troops that came to Yellow Bank⁠—Oquawka⁠—on their way to the sea of war, Major <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S. S.</abbr> Phelps always spoke in high terms of their good discipline and gentlemanly conduct, except in one instance⁠—that of a few persons in a company from McDonough county, who came over at a time when old chief Tama and his wife, who was noted for being the white man’s friend, came over to get provisions for his little band. On seeing an Indian some of these soldiers, who had been using their canteens rather frequently, were eager to slay him, and not only threatened him but Major <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> also, for harboring him. The officers seemed to have no control of these men⁠—and just at a time when their threats were loudest of what they intended to do at the close of three minutes, Major <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> and one of his clerks, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Joseph Smart, were standing with their rifles cocked ready to make the first shot, a cry came from outside of the building, by one of the more peaceable soldiers, “Here comes another company, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Peter Butler’s, from Monmouth,” when these would-be braves instantly retreated.</p>
				<p>We are assured by one of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">B.</abbr>’s company, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Ryason, that the foregoing is literally true, and that Major <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Smart, afterwards, amid the threats of these same soldiers, escorted Tama and wife to the river bank to take their canoe to cross the river, and stood there with their guns, ready to protect the Indians until they got out of reach of gunshot⁠—Smart threatening all the time to put a ball though the first man that attempted to shoot.</p>
				<p>In order to appease the wrath of these soldiers and prevent some of them being killed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">B.</abbr> advised <abbr>Maj.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> not to give Tama any provisions; but on the way down, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ryason says, Smart (who talked their language equal to a native born) told them to meet them at a certain point after night and they would be supplied; and that for the purpose of assisting <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Smart in taking supplies to Tama, he got leave of absence from the Captain until next morning.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> James Ryason and Gabriel Shot, both honorable and highly respected Christian gentlemen, are the only survivors of that company now residing in this county.</p>
				<p>Tama’s village, located on South Henderson, half a mile below the farm of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Cook, at Gladstone, was always noted as being the abode of friendly Indians. In the fall of 1829, some white men came in and made improvements on the land in the vicinity, and at the advice of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Phelps, Tama crossed the river and made a new town at the mouth of Flint river on the Mississippi, and at the time of Black Hawk’s raid into Illinois, it was the rendezvous of many young men who had been persuaded by Tama not to join Black Hawk. But when the news reached them of the indignities offered to their good old chief, they secretly determined to go upon the war path, and soon after four young Foxes started to cross the river and avenge the insult. On going up Henderson creek they espied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Martin while in the act of mowing, at a point near Little York, whom they shot and killed, and for fear of detection, immediately took to the brush. It being late when they got through the woods, they made a fire and camped just at the edge of the prairie.</p>
				<p>Some time after the shooting, friends of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Martin discovered his lifeless body and after removing it to the home, started on the trail of his murderers, and followed it some distance through the underbrush, but wisely concluded, as it was growing late, to return and give the alarm. An express was sent to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Butler during the night, who started out with his company early in the morning, and on emerging into the prairie discovered the camp fire of the Indians, and followed their trail to a slough in the Mississippi two miles below Keithsburgh. Here the Indians embarked in their canoes and were probably on the other side of the river by this time. A demand was immediately made upon Keokuk for the murderers, as they belonged to his band of Foxes, who surrendered two men to the commanding officer at Rock Island.</p>
				<p>These Indians soon afterwards made their escape, and before the time fixed for their trial, Keokuk delivered four young men to Maj. Phelps, then sheriff of Warren county, to be tried for the offence. <abbr>Maj.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> and his deputy, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Ryason, took them to Monmouth jail, where the following proceedings were had before the Circuit Court (for a copy of which we are indebted to George <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Rankin, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, now Circuit Clerk):</p>

						<p>Warren County Circuit Court</p>
					</header>
					<p>William Martin was shot and scalped by two Indians, near Little York, Warren county, August 9th, 1832. In their report at the October term of the Warren Circuit Court, the Grand jurors say:</p>
					<p>“Six or seven Indians of Keokuk’s band of Sac and Fox Indians who were not included in the war path under Black Hawk and other chiefs of the Sac and Fox nation, came over from the western bank of the Mississippi river to the inhabited parts of Warren county, in said State, and unlawfully and feloniously murdered the said William Martin in the most barbarous manner. That the names of the said Indians are unknown to the Grand Jury. That two of the said Indians have been heretofore given up by the chiefs of said Indians, that they were confined in the Fort at Rock Island for some time but have made their escape, and are now at large in their own country. That the Grand jury cannot now find an indictment because the names of the said Indiana are unknown to said jury. But they recommend that the Governor of the State be furnished with a copy of this presentment, and that he be desired to request of the President of the United States that the whole of the said Indians concerned in the said murder may be demanded of the said Sac and Fox nation that they may be indicted and punished for murder under the authority of the laws of this State.”</p>
					<p>In compliance with the demand of the President, the chiefs surrendered four Indians, namely, with their Interpretations;</p>
					<p>Sa-sa-pi-ma (he that troubleth).</p>
					<p>Ka-ke-mo (he that speaks with something in his mouth).</p>
					<p>I-o-nah (stay here).</p>
					<p>Wa-pa-sha-kon (the white string).</p>
					<p>Concerning which, the Grand jury at the June term 1833 say:</p>
					<p>“From an examination made by this Grand Jury they are now able to state that the four Indians lately surrendered by the chiefs at the request of the President of the United States, are not the real murderers of Martin. The chiefs represent that at the time the demand was made the real offenders had escaped from the territory and power of their nation. That the prisoners now in custody volunteered themselves to be surrendered in place of those who escaped, and that from custom amongst Indians, they supposed this would be a sufficient compliance with the requisition of the President. The Grand jury will not positively say that the chiefs have prevaricated, but they do say that the demand already made has been eluded.”</p>
					<p>By a writ of habeas corpus, the four Indians above named were brought before the judge, presiding, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Hon.</abbr> Richard <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Young, June 14th, 1833, and released.</p>
					<p>Indictment was returned against the real murderers, Shash-quo-washi, Muck-que-che-qua, Muck-qua-pal-ashah, and Was-a-wau-a-quot, who, “not having the fear of God before their eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigations of the devil,” killed <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Martin. The indictment was drawn by Thomas Ford, States Attorney, and recites that William Martin was shot a little below the shoulder blade. Among the witnesses named were Keokuk and Stabbing Chief. The guilty parties were never arrested, and a <i xml:lang="la">nolle prosequi</i> was entered at the October term at court, 1835.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title"><abbr>Gen.</abbr> Scott Arrives at Chicago</h3>
				<p>Gen. Scott, with a full regiment of regulars, came up the lake and landed at Chicago about the 10th of July⁠—the cholera in the meantime having broken out among his troops, from which several had died. While encamped at that point, it continued its virulence to such an extent, and in a number of cases fatally, that he deemed it best to march out on the high land, and soon after continued his journey, by slow marches, to Rock Island. On reaching Rock river, where Milan is now situated, the cholera had disappeared, and he went into camp with his entire regiment. The clear water of this beautiful stream was a godsend to the many tired men, for the ablution of their bodies and the cleansing of their apparel, tents, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and seemed to have a general invigorating effect upon the entire regiment.</p>
				<p>Gen. Scott then went over to Rock Island with two companies to garrison Fort Armstrong, and there learned the situation of affairs in the army, and the great reduction made in the ranks of Black Hawk’s band of Indians, so that a final close of the war was daily expected.</p>
				<p>A few days after their arrival at Fort Armstrong, symptoms of cholera again appeared among the troops of the company, and the physician in charge tried every known remedy to check it, but failed in every instance, and after running its course, which was usually about twenty-four hours, the patient died. During the first three or four days of its ravages, about one-half of that company had been consigned to their last resting place in the soldiers’ cemetery.</p>
				<p>Being on a visit to Rock Island at the time the cholera was raging, the writer, at the request of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Berry, (who had also come down from Galena to pay his respects to Gen. Scott,) accompanied him to the Fort and introduced him to the General. It was a very warm, but beautiful Sabbath, when we were admitted to the General’s quarters, about 10 o’clock in the morning, and after the introduction of our friend and the usual salutations of the day, the General, after expressing his doubts of the propriety of admitting us into the Fort, forcibly and touchingly detailed the ravages that the cholera was making in his ranks. Medicine, in the hands of a skillful physician, seemed to have no effect to stay its progress, and he was just on the eve of trying a different remedy as we came in, and if we would join him in a glass of brandy and water, he would proceed at once to put it into execution. He said he was satisfied that brandy was a good antidote to cholera, and by its use many of his soldiers were still well.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="appendix-3" epub:type="chapter">
				<h3 epub:type="title">The General’s Remedy</h3>
				<p>The General pulled off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and directed an orderly to tear off strips of red flannel, fill a bucket with brandy and carry them to the hospital. On arriving at the bedside of a patient he directed him to be stripped, and then with flannel soaked in brandy he rubbed his chest thoroughly, in order to bring on a reaction, in the meantime administering a little brandy with a spoon. In the course of half an hour he returned and reported progress. He said he left his patient free from pain, and directed a small portion of the brandy to be given occasionally.</p>
				<p>The well soldiers, seeing that their General was not afraid of cholera, nor too proud to act as nurse to a sick soldier, took courage and insisted on his retiring, so that they could fill his place. Seeing that new life had been infused among the well soldiers, and a gleam of hope seeming to inspire the sick, he gave directions for them to continue, as he had commenced, and then retired.</p>
				<p>On returning to his quarters he washed his hands, rolled down his sleeves, put on his uniform, and then invited us to take a little brandy. After listening to his mode of treatment, we casually remarked that it looked feasible, but at the same time reprehensible in the General of the army exposing himself in the performance of a duty that could be done as well by a common soldier. He gave us a look, and kept his eyes upon us as his giant form raised up, and, with a sweep of his sword arm, said in majestic tones: “Sir, it is the duty of a General to take care of his army; should he fall another can take his place; but, without an army his occupation is gone!”</p>
				<p>The General’s treatment was continued right along, and the result was that many of those attacked got well.</p>
				<p>Soon after the close of the war, which terminated with the battle of Bad Axe, on the second day of August, 1832, he came to Galena, and, in conference with Governor John Reynolds, ordered the chiefs, head men and warriors of the Winnebago Nation to meet them at Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, on the 15th day of September, 1832, for the purpose of holding a treaty.</p>
				<p>At the time fixed by the Commissioners they were met by the chiefs, head men and warriors of the Winnebago Nation, with whom a treaty was made and concluded, by which the Winnebagoes ceded to the United States all the lands claimed by them lying to the south and east of Wisconsin river and the Fox river of Green Bay. The consideration of this cession on the part of the United States, to be a grant to the Winnebago Nation of a tract on the west side of the Mississippi river known as the neutral ground and annual annuities for twenty-seven years of $10,000 in specie and a further sum, not to exceed $3,000 annually, for the purposes of maintaining a farm and a school for the education of Winnebago children during the same period of twenty-seven years.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Treaty with Sacs and Foxes</h3>
				<p>After concluding the treaty with the Winnebagoes, and for the purpose of making a lasting peace with the Sacs and Foxes, these Commissioners held a treaty at the same place, and a week later, on the 21st day of September, with chiefs, head men and warriors of that confederate tribe. The Commissioners demanded, partly as indemnity for expenses incurred in the late war with Black Hawk’s band and to secure future tranquility, a cession of a large portion of their country bordering on the frontiers. In consideration thereof the United States agree to pay to said confederate tribes annually, for thirty years, $20,000 in specie; also, to pay <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Farnham and Davenport, Indian traders at Rock Island, the sum of $40,000, to be receipted for in full of all demands against said Indians. And, further, at the special request of said confederate tribes, the United States agree to grant, by letters patent, to their particular friend, Antoine LeClair, interpreter, one section of land opposite Rock Island and one section at the head of the rapids of the Mississippi river.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The City of Davenport, Iowa</h3>
				<p>This beautiful city now covers that “Section of land opposite Rock Island” that was donated by treaty to Antoine LeClair by the Sacs and Foxes, and also three or four more sections. At that time it was wholly uninhabited, the Foxes having removed their village from that point some three years before. As a town site it was regarded by strangers and travelers on steamboats as the most beautiful west of the Mississippi between <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis and <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul, and now, with its twenty-three thousand inhabitants, elegant residences, magnificent public buildings, fine churches, schoolhouses, extensive manufactories, and large business blocks, it stands unrivalled as a beautiful city. It has ten miles of street railroads, affording easy access to all parts of the city. It has two daily papers, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Gazette</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Democrat</i>, (morning and evening) both ably conducted; and also a German daily and two weeklies.

It has fine public buildings, elegant churches and residences, substantial business blocks, extensive manufactories and elegant water works. The city is lighted by electric lights, from high towers, that cast their refulgent rays over the entire city, which makes it the finest lighted city in the west. There are two daily papers, (morning and evening) <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Union</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Argus</i>, both enjoying the privilege of Press dispatches, and both issue weeklies. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Rock Islander</i> is also published weekly, and all have the appearance of great prosperity. The professions are represented by men of fine ability, including some of wide reputation. The banking business is done principally by two National Banks, that have a deservedly high reputation, and are doing a large business. There are two first-class hotels⁠—the Harper House and Rock Island House⁠—and several of less pretentions. The city has large coal fields, in close proximity, with railroads running daily to and from the banks, by which the three cities are supplied.</p>

				<p>is located two miles up the river from Rock Island, but connected with it by street railways.

				<h3 epub:type="title">Fifty Years Ago</h3>
				<p>when the writer first visited this most beautiful Island in the Mississippi river, then and now known as Rock Island, the ground on which the triplet cities of Davenport, Rock Island, and Moline now stands, was covered with prairie grass, and apparently a sterile waste as regards to the two former, whilst the latter was principally covered with timber. Now how changed! Then the site of Davenport was claimed to be the most beautiful on the west bank of the Mississippi, between <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul and <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis by Black Hawk and his confreres, who had traveled up and down the river in canoes, whilst his judgment was confirmed by thousands of passengers who viewed it from steamboats in after years.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Triple Cities</h3>
				<p class="continued">are widely known as the leading manufacturing cities of the great west, with railroads stretching out from ocean to ocean, and although the Mississippi makes a dividing line, they are united by a magnificent bridge, which makes their intercourse easier than over paved streets.</p>
				<p>Rock Island, at that time, was excluded from settlement by the orders of Government, as it had been reserved, on the recommendation of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Hon.</abbr> Lewis Cass, whilst he was in the Senate and Cabinet, as a site for a United States Arsenal and Armory. Fort Armstrong was situated on the lower end of the Island, and was then in command of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> William Davenport. The Sac and Fox agency (Maj. Davenport, agent,) stood on the bank of the river about half a mile above the Fort; next came the residence and office of Antoine Le Clair, United States Interpreter for the Sam and Foxes, and a little higher up, the residence, storehouse and out buildings of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> George Davenport, who had by an act of Congress, preempted a claim of two hundred acres of land running across the Island from bank to bank of the river. The Island is about two miles long, and being at the foot of the rapids has the best water power on the river, capable of running a much greater amount of machinery than is at present in operation. The entire Island is now owned and occupied by the Government, (the heirs of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> Davenport having sold and deeded their interest), and is now used as an</p>

				<p class="continued">which are destined to be in the near future, the most extensive works of the kind probably in the world. Indeed, army officers who have traveled extensively in the Old World, say they have never seen anything to compare with it, in elegant grounds, water power and buildings, and with such facilities for moving anything to and from the Arsenal. These works were commenced under the supervision of Gen. Rodman, the inventor of the Rodman gun, and since the death of the General, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D. W.</abbr> Flagler, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Lieut.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> of Ordinance, has been in command, and a more efficient and better qualified officer for the place could not have been found in the army.</p>
				<p>There are already completed ten massive stone buildings, which are used for work shops, storage, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, officers’ quarters, both durable and comfortable, and many other buildings. The former residence of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> George Davenport, (the House in which he as killed for money many years ago) built in 1831, of solid hewed timber, and afterwards weather-boarded, still stands unoccupied.</p>
				<p>The Island is mostly covered with trees of different varieties, which are kept neatly trimmed, and is laid out like a park, with wide avenues extending its whole length, which makes the most elegant drives and shady walks for the thousands of visitors who flock to the Island to feast their eyes upon its magnificence.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The City of Keokuk, Iowa</h3>
				<p>is located at the foot of the Lower Rapids, 139 miles from Rock Island, and bears the name of the distinguished chief of the Sacs and Foxes. At our first visit there, in 1832, there was a long row of one-story buildings fronting on the river, that were used by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> Farnham, agent of the American Fur Company, as a store and warehouse⁠—this being the principal depot for trade with the Sacs and Foxes, who were then the sole proprietors of the country and its principal inhabitants, with the exception of a few individuals who had got permission to put up shanties for occupation during the low-water season, while they were engaged in lighting steamers passing up and down the river, but unable to cross the rapids while loaded.</p>
				<p>At that day the old chief, Keokuk, boasted of having the handsomest site for a big village that could be found on the river, and since that day it has grown to be a large and elegant city, with wide streets, fine public buildings, nice churches, schoolhouses, elegant residences, extensive business houses, wholesale and retail stores, manufactories, and a flourishing Medical University with elegant buildings, which has been in successful operation for more than twenty years. The United States District Court for Southern Iowa is also located here. The city is well provided with good hotels. The Patterson House, an immense building, five stories high, being chief, which has always ranked as first-class⁠—with a number of hotels of smaller dimensions, but well kept⁠—affording ample accommodation for the thousands of travelers that frequently congregate at this place.

They have two daily papers, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Gale City</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Constitution</i>, which are ably conducted.</p>
				<p>A fine canal, running the entire length of the Rapids, from Montrose to Keokuk, has been built by the United States, through which steamboats can now pass at any stage of water⁠—but designed more particularly for low water⁠—so that there is no longer any detention to lighten steamboats over the Rapids.</p>

				<p>Muscatine was first settled as a wood yard by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> John Vanater, in July, 1834, and was laid out as a town by him in 1836, and called Bloomington. The county was organized in 1837, under the name of Muscatine, and Bloomington made the county seat. The name of the town was changed to correspond with that of the county in 1851. Its population at the last census was 8,294; present population not less than 10,000. Besides being the centre of a large trade in agricultural products, it is extensively engaged in manufacturing lumber, sash, doors and blinds, and possesses numerous large manufactories, oatmeal mills, and the finest marble works in the State. It is also the centering point of a very large wholesale and retail trade. It is situated at the head of the rich Muscatine Island, the garden spot of the Northwest, and is the shipping point for millions of melons and sweet potatoes annually.</p>
				<p>Muscatine is a good town, with a good business and good newspapers.

				<h3 epub:type="title">The City of Dubuque</h3>
				<p>Soon after the close of the war and the discharge of the volunteer army, the writer, with some twenty others who had served through the war, formed a company for the purpose of laying out the town of Dubuque. One of their number, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> James Craig, being a surveyor, he was selected to survey the lines and lay out the town. About the middle of September, 1832, he started out from Galena with his chain-carriers, stake-drivers, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, (stakes having been previously sawed and split on an island opposite, all ready for use), and in due time completed the survey. Blocks fronting the river on three or four streets back were completed, each lot receiving its stakes, whilst those farther back were staked as blocks, and not subdivided. A few of the original proprietors built and took possession at once. Among them were the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Langworthy, enterprising and energetic young gentlemen, who commenced business as grocers in a small way, with supplies for miners. Their faith was strong that adventurers would come in, and that the time was not far distant when the town would take a start, and in a few years become a populous city. Miners and prospectors soon took possession of claims in the immediate vicinity, and in one instance a claim was made and ore struck within the limits of our survey.</p>
				<p>It was well known that the Indians had been in the habit, for many years, of visiting this portion of their country, for the purpose of getting their supplies of lead; hence the supposition of miners, who had long been engaged in prospecting for lead-mining, that lead would be found on this side of the river and in the vicinity of Dubuque. This caused a great rush to the new fields, of hundreds, who expected to strike it rich with less labor and expense. All were aware, however, that under the treaty just made with the Sacs and Foxes by Gen. Scott and <abbr>Gov.</abbr> Reynolds, they had no right to enter upon these lands, and stood in daily fear of being ordered off by United States troops. But their numbers steadily increased. At length the long expected order came. Major Davenport, Indian Agent at Rock Island, was ordered to go forward, and, with one company of infantry in two Mackinaw boats, commanded by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Lieut.</abbr> Beach, they landed near the mouth of Fever river (Galena) about the first of October. The Major came up to Galena with a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> George Davenport to the writer, to assist him in the discharge of his delicate duty. Word was sent to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Lieut.</abbr> Beach not to proceed up the river until the afternoon of the next day, as the sight of troops by the miners might make them hard to manage; otherwise, I assured the Major, he would have no trouble. We proceeded at once to a point opposite Dubuque, where we found a comfortable stopping place with the ferryman, and he being a man of considerable influence, I suggested to him the propriety of going over to Dubuque to send men to all the mining camps, requesting a meeting the next morning, at nine o’clock, of all the miners, with the agent, to hear what he had to say, and to assure them at the same time that his mission was a peaceable one, and that there should be no objection manifested to disobey the orders of the Government.</p>
				<p>After the departure of our messenger we took a private room to talk over the programme for the meeting, when we suggested that, on assembling, the Major should make a little speech explanatory of his visit, in which he should express sorrow for the hardships it would be to leave their claims, with the hope that the time was not distant when all might lawfully return, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> The Major said he was not a speechmaker, or a very good talker, but would read the orders sent to him to dispossess them, and see that they crossed the river.</p>
				<p>After some discussion, the writer, at his request, wrote out a short address for the Major, and on going over the next morning, we met some four or five hundred miners at the grocery store, who had assembled to listen to the orders sent for their removal. There being no boards or boxes into which to improvise a stand for the speaker, a whisky-barrel was introduced, from the head of which, after apologizing to the miners for the disagreeable duty that had been placed upon the Major, and in consequence of his suffering from a bad cold, we had taken the stand to read to them his short address, and as most of them had spent the summer in the service of the Government as soldiers in the field, and had been honorably discharged, the Major felt satisfied that there would be no objection manifested by anyone in the large crowd before us to disobey an order from the Government. After the close of the Major’s address, the question was put to vote by raising of hands. There was a general upraising of hands, which was declared to be unanimous for immediate removal. Owing to the good treatment received by the Major, he proposed to treat the entire party, and, to facilitate the matter, buckets of whisky with tin cups were passed around, and after all had partaken they shook hands with the Major and commenced crossing over in flatboats.</p>
				<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon we crossed over on the last boat, and took our departure for Galena. During the evening the Major’s report of how his peaceable removal of a large body of intruders from the west to the east bank of the Mississippi had been accomplished, was made out and mailed. But the further fact that all those miners had re-crossed the river, and were then in their mining camps, was not recorded, for the reason that the Major had not been posted as to their intentions.</p>
				<p>Owing to the provisions of the treaty, it was a long time before Congress passed an act for the sale of these lands, and confirmation to the titles of town sites, hence, many of those who had laid out the town of Dubuque had left the county, and at the time of proving up their claims failed to put in an appearance⁠—the writer being one of them⁠—whilst those who remained, with the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Langworthy, became sole proprietors⁠—the latter having lived to see the town rise in importance, and at this time become one of the most populous cities on the west side of the Mississippi.</p>
